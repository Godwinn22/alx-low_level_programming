 * main - Entry point
 * Description: The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to
 * help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates
 * who can’t seem to program their
 * way out of a wet paper bag. Write a program that prints the numbers from
 * 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print
 * Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz.
 * For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
 * Each number or word should be separated by a space.
 * Return: Always 0 (success)
